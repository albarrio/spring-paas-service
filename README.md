# spring-paas-service
SpringBoot Application Java push in DockerRepository and deploy in Heroku service.
I implement entire pipeline for this project
For CI I used Travis-CI
For CD I create a Docker image and push it to DockerHub
As the last part I deploy the application on cloud-based PaaS Heroku.
